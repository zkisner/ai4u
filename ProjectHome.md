This Java package includes generic interfaces for turn based games, which are used in implementations of known AI algorithms such as:
  * Minimax
  * Alpha Beta
  * Weights learning AI
  * Decision trees


Also includes a game that implements the interfaces for code examples.
This is a Checkers game which is implemented using a unique bit-wise data representation and bit-wise manipulations as a way to calculate the moves and board representations.
